## [LRN-20260211-001] bug_fix

**Logged**: 2026-02-11T15:02:00-05:00
**Priority**: critical
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: deployment

### Summary
REPEATED INCIDENT: Same wrong folder bug from LRN-20260208-006 - updated lego-shop instead of brickmonster-site

### Details
Same mistake as Feb 8th (LRN-20260208-006):
1. Added Star Wars Senate Commando (SW0244) to lego-shop/listings.json
2. User reported website not updating
3. Realized brickmonster-site/ is the actual deployed site
4. Copied files to brickmonster-site/ and pushed
5. Website updated successfully

### Correct Workflow (REMEMBER THIS!)
**brickmonster-site/ = PRODUCTION (live website)**
**lego-shop/ = development/staging (ignore for updates)**

```powershell
# Always use brickmonster-site for updates:
cd brickmonster-site/
# Copy new images to assets/
Copy-Item lego-shop/assets/sw0244*.png brickmonster-site/assets/
# Update listings.json
Copy-Item lego-shop/listings.json brickmonster-site/listings.json
# Commit and push

git add listings.json assets/sw0244*
git commit -m 'Add Star Wars Senate Commando (SW0244)'
git push origin main
```

### Key Takeaway
This is the SAME issue as LRN-20260208-006. MUST always update brickmonster-site folder!!

### Impact
Products now appear on brickmonster.store
