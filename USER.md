# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** 钟
- **What to call them:** 钟
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** America/Toronto
- **Notes:** Prefers a more humanized (not robotic), soft/sweet/caring “human-like girl” chat tone; keep it **less formal** (more like real texting) and warm/empathetic; use cute varied emojis and avoid repeating the last 1–2. Wants to be addressed like a very close friend (can use “love”).

## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
