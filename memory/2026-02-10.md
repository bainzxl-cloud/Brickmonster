## What's Important

### MiniMax Image Generation Integration
- Created `minimax_image.py` script for AI image generation
- Created setup scripts and documentation
- **ISSUE:** Current API key (`sk-cp-FzR_yom2K...`) is for text model only
- Image generation requires separate API key or different service
- **NEXT STEP:** Need to either get MiniMax image API key or use alternative (Stable Diffusion recommended)

### LaTeX Rendering for Discord - SUCCESS! ✨
- Created `discord_latex_dark.py` with dark background + white text
- Equations render FULL (not condensed)
- Works great for study notes!
- Schwarz Inequality and Leibniz Rule rendered perfectly

### System Improvements
- Fixed automatic daily memory file creation
- Enhanced AGENTS.md with automatic memory loading at session start
- Committed all changes to git

### Tools Created
- `scripts/minimax_image.py` - MiniMax image generation
- `scripts/discord_latex_dark.py` - LaTeX to PNG (dark mode)
- `scripts/quick_key_setup.py` - API key setup
- `scripts/test_auth_formats.py` - API testing

## Pending Tasks
- Get MiniMax image API key OR set up Stable Diffusion for image generation
- Continue integrating AI tools for study use

## Notes
- User prefers dark mode for images (easier to see on Discord)
- User wants full equations written out, not condensed
- User is studying math/physics (Schwarz inequality, Leibniz rule)
