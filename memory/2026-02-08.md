## Discord hourly memory digest
- Ran: 2026-02-08T22:16:00-05:00

- Working voice bot setup (ASA#3982 Discord bot for voice channel)
- Piper TTS voice system installed (cute British voice)
- Whisper.cpp STT for speech-to-text (local, uses RTX 4050 GPU)
- Memory digest script updated to use llama3.2:3b instead of gpt-oss:20b (faster, more reliable)
- Voice bot runs via PowerShell: `cd C:\Users\bainz\clawd\voice-bot; node index.js`
- Commands: `asa join` (join voice), `asa leave` (leave voice), `asa stt` (transcribe)
- Text replies remain primary; voice replies limited to 1-2 sentences

## Research Skills Installed

### Self-Improving Agent
- Captures learnings, corrections, errors, feature requests
- Location: `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md`
- Logs: corrections, knowledge gaps, best practices

### Senior Data Scientist
- Statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, curve fitting
- Uncertainty calculation: standard deviation, SEM, 95% CI
- Perfect for physics research data analysis

### Data Visualization
- Creates graphs using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Generates PNG images and interactive HTML dashboards
- Charts: scatter plots, line graphs, 3D plots, heatmaps

### Academic Research Hub
- Searches arXiv, PubMed, Semantic Scholar
- Downloads research papers
- Generates citations and bibliographies
- Dependencies installed: requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml, arxiv
- Working but arXiv API requests are slow (server-side)

## Today's Learnings
- Local LLM models (llama3.2:3b) more reliable for automation than gpt-oss:20b
- Memory digest only processes NEW messages since last run
- Smaller/faster models better for scripted tasks
