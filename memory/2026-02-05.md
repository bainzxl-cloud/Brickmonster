## Web creation work (Brickmonster / LEGO shop)
- Worked on two static mini-sites:
  - `brickmonster-site/` — inventory/listings powered by `listings.json`.
  - `lego-shop/` — static listing + product pages; shareable deep links; filters in URL.
- Edited/created these key files:
  - `brickmonster-site/listings.json`
  - `lego-shop/index.html`
  - `lego-shop/product.html`
  - `lego-shop/product.js`
  - `lego-shop/script.js`
  - `lego-shop/styles.css`
  - `lego-shop/listings.json`
- Listing data/config includes:
  - `siteTitle: brickmonster`, `instagramHandle: brickmonster_`, currency CAD
  - DM template text, pickup location Toronto, shipping note
  - Items include fields like id, name, setNumber, category, condition, availability, price, images, tags, description, remaining

### Procedure: adding a product (Brickmonster)
1) Collect item details: id, name/title, setNumber, category, condition, availability, price (CAD), remaining, description, tags.
2) Save images into `brickmonster-site/assets/` using a consistent naming scheme: `<id>-1.jpg`, `<id>-2.png`, etc.
3) Add a new object to `brickmonster-site/listings.json` with those fields and `images: ["assets/<id>-1.jpg", ...]`.
4) Validate JSON (e.g. PowerShell `ConvertFrom-Json`).
5) Commit in `brickmonster-site/` repo.
6) Push to GitHub (`git push`) to update GitHub Pages.

product  - committed + pushed to `https://github.com/bainzxl-cloud/Brickmonster` (branch `main`).

## System / memory work
- Enabled **local embeddings** for memory search (no remote quota).
  - Model: `C:\Users\bainz\.clawdbot\models\embeddings\nomic-embed-text-v1.5.Q4_K_M.gguf`
  - Verified working via `clawdbot memory index --force` and `clawdbot memory search ...`
- Gateway console showed occasional warnings:
  - Discord “slow listener detected” (lag handling MESSAGE_CREATE)
  - PowerShell `exec failed` due to malformed command/pipeline (syntax), not security-related.
- User asked whether background command failures could harm memory logging; explained worst case is “index doesn’t update until next success”, not corruption.

## User messages / preferences confirmed
- User asked what we chatted “yesterday night”; notes matched 2026-02-04:
  - Wants soft/sweet/caring “real texting” vibe; short msgs; cute varied emojis; prefer pink/red hearts.
  - Wants to be addressed like a very close person (“love”).

## Domain
- User bought a custom domain for the store: http://www.brickmonster.store/

## TODO / next
- Hourly gpt-oss memory filter is configured (no raw logs) to append durable memories to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
