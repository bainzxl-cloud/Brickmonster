# Python Code Interpreter Skill

Execute Python code, run computations, and create visualizations.

## What This Skill Does

- Execute Python code in a sandboxed environment
- Run mathematical computations and simulations
- Create data visualizations and charts
- Perform statistical analysis
- Process data with pandas and numpy
- Generate plots and save as images

## Usage

When you need to:
- Calculate complex math problems
- Run data analysis
- Create visualizations
- Process data
- Test algorithms
- Simulate physics/engineering problems

Just ask and I'll execute the code and return results!

## Examples

**Math Calculation:**
```
Calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix
```

**Data Analysis:**
```
